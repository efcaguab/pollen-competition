# Meeting feedbacks

## Hugo

* Phylogenies seem to be the best alternative to provide missing trait data. I will check with Daniel and Jason. 
* Explore option of using structural equation modelling approach or a simplification of the models 
* If methodological approach stays the same: 
* Need to improve definition of gain
* Need to improve last two paragraphs of the methods
* Consider doing a figure explaining the approach 
* If methodological approach changes:
* Check “specialisation” index of bluthingen and Chacoff paper for species richness and visitation quality/quantity

# Daniel

* Methodology is more complicated that what it needs to be, consider using one model with many interactions instead
* Pay attention at how you include phenology in the traits, might not be correct

## Jason

* Hypothesis: think about how you would explain your results to a leading network scientist in an elevator. You need to predispose readers view so that when they read the results in the discussion they know exactly what to expect. Example: There is a trade-off between two strategies, to minimise the amounts of heterospecific pollen, or to maximise the ammounts of heterospecific pollen even if it's accompained by a an increasse in heterospecific pollen. Furthermore, the proximate mechanisms of how plants do this is by traits (or abundance, etc)... Then explain what we should observe for each alternative.
* Define terms clearly. Potential for selfing and others require this. Be explicit, as in "we define XXX as..."
* No need to change methods, explain them better
* Rewrite methods and if it's still unclear make a figure
* For each figure start it with the result you want people to understand from the figure.
* Include the dychotomy of absolute and relative as in the intro. Presenr absolute and relative as two views of the same problem. What one explains is different to that the other explains. Not as a methods thing but as a motivation/finding. 
* To check on how to integrate phylogeny and traits check "Bastazini, V. A. G. et al. Untangling the Tangled Bank: A Novel Method for Partitioning
the Effects of Phylogenies and Traits on Ecological Networks. Evol. Biol., 1-13, (2017)."
* Phenology as a trait is fine. Use absolute abundance instead. And wheight all phylogeny columns independently.
