Dear Mr Cagua,

I am writing to inform you that we have now obtained responses from referees on manuscript RSPB-2019-1613 entitled "Community context determines competition vs. facilitation trade-offs in pollination systems" which you submitted to Proceedings B.

I am sorry to have to tell you that, based on the reports from the Associate Editor and the referees, your manuscript has been rejected following full peer review. Competition for space in Proceedings B is currently extremely severe, as many more manuscripts are submitted to us than we have space to print. We are therefore only able to publish those that are exceptional, convincing and present significant advances of broad interest, and must reject many good manuscripts.

Please find below the comments received from referees concerning your manuscript, not including confidential reports to the Editor. I hope you may find these useful should you wish to submit your manuscript elsewhere.

We are sorry that your manuscript has had an unfavourable outcome, but would like to thank you for offering your work to Proceedings B.

Yours sincerely,
Professor Loeske Kruuk

Comments to Author:
This manuscript has now been reviewed by two reviewers.  The first reviewer, with great experience in this particular area of pollination biology gave an extremely thorough review of the manuscript and suggested that in addition to several other problems, the main assumptions of the manuscript were fundamentally flawed: facilitation was assumed to be associated with a positive relationship between heterospecific and conspecific pollen. In contrast competition was assumed to be associated with a negative relationship.   

The second reviewer did not give a particularly comprehensive review but essentially echoed the sentiments of the first reviewer by writing that the manuscript was scientifically unsound, because the entire structure and methods of the manuscript were based on assumptions which were poorly supported.  While this reviewer did admit that he/she was perhaps not the best qualified person to review the manuscript (and that I may need to find a third reviewer), I have elected not to send this to a third reviewer because even a positive third review would not have been enough to counter the arguments of the first reviewer.

I have also read this manuscript and am in agreement with the two reviewers: that the primary assumptions of this manuscript are too simplistic and were not founded on any real evidence or data.  I was not convinced that negative vs positive slopes for stigmatic pollen were necessarily indicative of facilitation or competition. I too thought that there could be multiple reasons for their existence (some of which were outlined by reviewer 1) and that these slopes didn’t necessarily say anything about competition or facilitation. The authors also didn’t turn to any other studies which conclusively demonstrated the functional significance of these slopes, suggesting that there is very little data in support of these assumptions. Such is the problem with correlative studies – it is often impossible to say anything about what the real driving variables are.  

In addition to the many valid points raised by reviewer one, I also have some additional points which may have important implications for this study: 

Plant fitness has both a male and a female component to it.  Stigmatic pollen loads examine the female component and assume that heterospecific pollen is detrimental to female fitness.  While this may be true for some plants, there are many examples where this is not the case.  If heterospecific pollen is not detrimental, it surely changes the assumptions about competition and facilitation. Consequently, the assumption of heteospecific pollen being detrimental should have been tested for the community members in this particular study. While the authors may argue that pollen loss to stigmas should always affect male fitness negatively, I don’t actually think that stigma loads on one species can say much about male fitness of another species.  

I also wandered what kinds of effects self-pollen may have of these stigmatic loads.  Self-pollen can be just as detrimental as heterospecific pollen.  However it is impossible to distinguish self- pollen from other conspecific pollen.  In this manuscript, there is a general assumption that conspecific pollen is good pollen, but this is not always the case if pollen is from the same plant or flower. It also makes the assumption that conspecific pollen is pollen that results from pollinator visits, but this is also not necessarily the case.
While the manuscript was very thought provoking and the ideas were interesting, I ultimately thought that the manuscript lacked the rigor required for publication in Proceedings B.  I am sorry that we are not able to give you better news on this manuscript.

## Referee: 1

In this study the authors evaluate the relative importance of pollinator-mediated competition and facilitation as well as the potential underlying factors mediating the strength of these interactions in natural plant communities. They further explore the potential trade-offs that occur when plants maximize the benefits of facilitation while avoiding the costs of competition. The authors evaluate these ideas mainly by making use of data on conspecific and heterospecific pollen loads found on stigmas. The ideas presented are interesting and I agree with the authors that the use of data collected from pollen o stigmas has the potential to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that allow co-flowering and that lead to facilitative and competitive interactions via pollinators.

However, I believe that in order for this type of information (pollen loads on stigmas) to be valuable, is important to acknowledge the role of all the factors that mediate pollen deposition stigmas. Unfortunately, I think the hypotheses presented and tested in this study are over-simplistic and overlook a multitude of factors that influence pollen transport and deposition, which may obscure the interpretation of the patterns observed. See for example the recent study by Minnar et al. 2018 where they do an excellent review of all the factors that affect pollen transport and deposition on stigmas including pollinator foraging and grooming behavior, floral morphology, pollen traits and abiotic factors. All of these factors have the potential to influence conspecific and heterospecific pollen receipt independently of the type of pollinator-mediated interaction taking place (i.e. competition or facilitation). For instance, I can think of two cases in which the predictions and interpretations presented here can be wrong. 

1) the authors state that a positive relationship between conspecific and heterospecific pollen is indicative of pollinator-mediated facilitation. However, if floral morphology, and/or differences in pollen placement on the pollinator body, restrict heterospecific pollen deposition (as it occurs in many species; see the works by Nathan Muchhala as examples) then pollinator facilitation may still occur and this will not be reflected as a positive relationship between conspecific and heterospecific pollen. In fact, this would result in a neutral relationship between the two pollen types. This could also explain why the authors do not find an effect of the degree of pollinator sharing and heterospecific pollen receipt, if flowers possess heterospecific pollen avoidance mechanisms this effect would not be expected. However, neither floral morphology, nor any of the other factors affecting pollen receipt, are considered in this study.

2) the authors state that a negative relationship between conspecific and heterospecific pollen is indicative of pollinator competition. However, the only instance where I can envision this occurring is when the presence of one type of pollen (e.g. conspecific) limits adherence/deposition of the other (e.g. heterospecific), and thus a tradeoff will occur because the two cannot be transported/deposited simultaneously. This would only occur if pollen loads on the stigma, or in the pollinator body reach saturation, and thus more heterospecific pollen would prevent deposition of conspecific pollen. But this is not always the case, and if space is not limiting no tradeoff would be expected as both types of pollen can still be carried and deposited. In fact, I can envision that a positive relationship between conspecific and heterospecific pollen but where heterospecific pollen accumulates faster than conspecific pollen (low slope) would be another, perhaps more realistic, signal of pollinator competition. As a higher accrual rate of heterospecific pollen would reflect more visits to heterospecific compared to conspecific flowers. However, under the predictions presented here this type of relationship would still be interpreted as facilitation (i.e. positive relationship), when this is likely not the case.

Furthermore, under the proposed hypotheses (i.e. only linear relationships) the authors make the unrealistic assumption that all pollinators are equally efficient. That is, all deliver conspecific and heterospecific pollen at the same rate and are equally represented in the community. This is unlikely to be the case and in cases where there is inequalities in the efficiency and/or abundance of pollinator species non-linear relationships can be expected (see Arceo-Gomez et al. 2016 for an example). The potential for non-linear relationships was not acknowledged in this study thus further obscuring the interpretation of the potential processes/factors that mediate patterns of pollen receipt on stigmas.
Thus, though I commend the authors for the amount of work conducted in this study, I believe the oversimplification of the hypotheses along with the lack of consideration of key factors that affect pollen transport and receipt are likely to lead to a misunderstanding of the real importance of pollinator-mediated competition and facilitation in these communities. 

I have other major and minor concerns regarding methods, data analyses, results and their interpretation that are outlined below.

I believe the authors are confounding the concepts of ‘evolutionary specialization’ to certain pollinators (see lines 81-82) with the concept of ‘functional originality’ (see lines 82-84). While the level of evolutionary specialization is an intrinsic characteristic of a species, the concept of ‘originality’ is relative, and it is affected by the presence or absence of other species in the community. Thus, it is not surprising to me that ‘functional originality’ varies across communities if communities differ in the identity and number of species present. The number and identity of species in a community is also likely to vary across seasons and thus species may be exposed to different ‘flowering communities’ across time within a single site. On the other hand, the level of ‘evolutionary specialization’ is intrinsic to a species and its value would only change depending on the pollinator community (composition and abundance) present at a given site. Unless, the authors expect that floral characteristics such as color and shape that affect its degree of evolutionary specialization can significantly differ across sites in a single species Thus, the authors should clarify which one are they referring to as this has profound implications for their predictions and interpretation of results.

Line 97 Unclear what the authors mean by ‘balance’ between competition and facilitation? What would be considered a ‘balance’? Please clarify.

Line 100 Are there any predictions on the relative importance of competition or facilitation across the studied communities? With no predictions this objective becomes rather descriptive and very little predictive knowledge can be gained from this result.

Line 110 Unclear what ‘visit potential’ means up to this point. Please define here so it is clear to the reader why this might be important.

Line 118-121 The predictions here are unclear. The authors state that if a plant strategy is ‘not flexible’ across communities they expect higher ‘niche’ similarity (i.e. similarity in trait space) within a species compared to trait similarity among species. This prediction does not seem to make sense as worded. In what instances would we expect that trait similarity would be greater among species compared to trait similarity within a single species? I also do not see how this latter outcome would suggest ‘niche flexibility’ across communities. Why compare within-species similarity with among-species similarity and not directly test if variation in trait space is greater within than among communities for a single species? This latter option seems a more direct way to test the proposed prediction (i.e. flexibility across communities). The logic behind these predictions needs to be clearly explained.

The information provided regarding the study sites is insufficient. Please state where are these sites specifically located (GPS coordinates), What is the distance between sites? What is the relevance of the fragments within each site? There is no mention in the introduction of comparing agricultural and restored sites and why. What is the distance between fragments within a site? What is being considered as restored vs agricultural? What are the differences in size, diversity and species composition between sites and fragments? All this information is relevant for the interpretation of differences between communities and to assess the independence of sites and fragments.

Line 134-135 This sentence is a clear example of the oversimplification in the hypotheses presented which leads to the misinterpretation of the patterns observed. The authors state that heterospecific pollen is the ‘unavoidable cost’ of pollinator sharing. There is plenty of evidence demonstrating that this is not the case and that floral adaptations and partitioning of pollen placement on the pollinators body are two efficient mechanisms to avoid this potential cost (see review by Minnar et al. 2018).

Line 146-147 please provide data on the abundance and levels of specialization for each one of the studied species. This can be included in an appendix but it would be useful to interpret the results.

Line 149 Please give detailed information on sample sizes. How many plants and flowers per species and site were collected? Where flowers collected from the same plant or different plants? Where these senesced flowers? All this information is vital to assess the soundness of the results.

Line 158-161 Unclear how different species, communities and fragments were treated in this model. Where all of them treated as random factors as well? 

176 Unclear why networks needed to be constructed to estimate the level of pollinator sharing between species when several indexes exist to estimate pollinator overlap and community similarity (e.g. Morisita index). What specific network metric was used to evaluate pollinator sharing?

179-180 where all plant species equally represented in the transects? This is important because network metrics, and the abundance and diversity of pollinators observed visiting each species, heavily relies on sampling effort which may be unequal if some species are poorly represented within the transects.

192-195 It is unclear how the ‘morphological’ traits selected here to evaluate ‘functional originality’ such as plant type (climber, herb, shrub), life cycle (annual vs perennial) and native vs invasive status are relevant in the context of pollination. Most of these would be considered life history traits that would be subjected to an entirely different set of selective pressures unrelated to pollination. The justification for the selection of these traits needs to be strongly justified if not changed so traits are more relevant to the ecological process that is being evaluated here (pollination).

Line 194 How was flower colouration measured?

Line 200-201 Authors refer as pollination service as the quantity and purity of the pollen load, purity being the amount of heterospecific pollen relative to the conspecific load. However, here they analyze the total number of heterospecific pollen grains. I agree the proportion is a more meaningful measure of the quality of the pollination service and this should be re-analyzed accordingly.

Line 2098-210 Why not include both plant species and community (and perhaps their interaction) as random effects in the model. Both are likely contributing to variation in pollen loads and there is no logic argument to why one of them needs to be excluded.

Line 214 what does pooling data mean? Please be more precise.

262 Please state how many species appear in three or more communities.

263-266 This approach seems to compare if ‘similarity’ within a species is different than similarity in a randomly selected group of species. However, it is not clear how this test evaluates if similarity in a species is greater within than among communities or vice versa, which is the prediction being tested as I understand it (line 249-250).

282-284 Please provide the statistical evidence and the hard data to support this argument. This implies the effect of a significant interaction but there is no statistical evidence to support this claim nor there is evidence that interactions were tested (was the significance of random effects tested?)

Fig 1 It is worrying that the sample sizes provided for some of the species in this figure (3-6 plants) are insufficient to make any meaningful statistical (and biological) inferences. This limitation should at least discussed, but perhaps that data should be re-analyzed only using those species for which a reliable amount of sampling is available.

311 What is slightly larger? This is subjective, please be more specific. Was the difference significant?

322-324 How was this tested? This information is important, if variables are correlated how is it possible to clearly determine which is the most important factor. This collinearity also likely violates the assumptions of the analysis.

348-349 I do not find this result surprising or even biologically meaningful. Species ‘niche’ was defined here by characteristics that are dependent/relative to other plant species (relative abundance, relative originality) and pollinator species (pollinator sharing) in a community. Thus, as communities change, species ‘niches’ change too. 

367-371 I find this sentence problematic as it implies that evolutionary process do not take place based on current selective pressures but based on potential/future risks on the long term. I do not think there is evidence to support this and that is why pollinator specialization has been said to be an evolutionary dead end. 

395-404 This paragraph is highly speculative in the context of this study as no fitness effects were measured and the degree of outcrossing and self-incompatibility is not provided for any of the species studied.

408 There is no data to support this argument. Neither the strength or direction of selection was evaluated in this study for any species, and the traits evaluated here were relative to other species in the community and not intrinsic to the species and is thus not clear how selection would act on these traits.

425-426 Unclear what the authors mean in this sentence. 

Overall, it is not clear in the discussion how this study helps advance our understanding of these ecological process and their importance in natural communities. For instance, in the final paragraph of the discussion the authors state as the main messages of this study that 1) pollinator-mediated competition is pervasive. This is not only not fully supported by the results (facilitation based on their analyses of pollen loads seems to be as frequent) but it is also well known that there is overwhelmingly more evidence for pollinator competition than facilitation in nature. 2) They also state that competition for pollination is a community process, which entirely ignores the contribution of studies on intraspecific competition within populations. 3) The authors also state that species can occupy different niches in different communities, which is also previously known from studies on variation in fundamental versus realized niches in a wide number of species. Finally, 4) the authors emphasize the need to acknowledge both pollinator-mediated competitive and facilitate interactions in plant communities, again overlooking the wealth of studies that exist on these two process and their importance in the assembly of plant communities, some of which are cited in this study.

## Referee: 2

I don't know the background theory well enough to have an authoritative opinion, but my impression is that this work has a weak foundation.  Relationships between conspecific and heterospecific deposition are too species-specific and too spatially determined to have the explanatory power assumed here.  Too many assertions are unfounded, or based on theory with untenable assertions  (e.g., that pollination success determines species coexistence).  Reports about a single species are taken as applying universally.  It's a provocative intellectual/logical exercise, but seems far removed from applicability.
