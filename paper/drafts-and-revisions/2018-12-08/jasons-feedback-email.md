Hi Fer,

Thanks very much for sending this. I think it’s looking really great, and much more focused around clear hypotheses while being arranged around a few key metrics. I’ve added a few comments in the attached, and suggested textual changes where words could be trimmed or where the meaning wasn’t clear. In terms of the discussion, I’d think about the following:

1. The networks you studied are something of a snapshot, and over long periods there could be risk to a plant associated with times of having no pollinators (if the plant is a specialist). How great would this risk need to be to compensate for the costs of sharing pollinators?
2. It’s commonly thought that species that are further from others in trait space suffer reduced competition, but Coux et al argued that this could come at the cost of being less ‘apparent’ to ones mutualists. This apparency problem could be overcome if you’re abundant and provide a valuable enough reward to make it worth pollinators while to develop a search image for you.
3. Some whole families of plants (Asteraceae for example) seem to go for pretty generalised pollination, whereas others (orchids) are commonly more specialised (if I may over-generalise). Would selection for a strategy say something about the community in which a species has typically inhabited during its evolutionary history?
4. In a more applied sense, people have looked at putting out flowering plants to attract pollinators - how might this affect pollination success on other nearby plants?

I hope you’re enjoying your time in Wellington, and again great work on the ms!
Cheers,
Jason
