A fundamental feature of pollination systems is the indirect facilitation and competition that arises when plant species share pollinators. 
The pollination service can be affected, not only on how many partners plant species share, but also by multiple intertwined factors like the plant species' abundance, visitation, or traits. 
These factors inherently operate at the community level. 
However, most of our understanding of how these factors may affect the pollination service is based on systems of up to a handful of species. 
By examining comprehensive empirical data in eleven natural communities, we show here that the pollination service is only partially influenced by the number of shared pollinators. 
Instead, the factors that most influence the pollination service (abundance and visit effectiveness) also introduce a trade-off between the absolute amount of conspecific pollen received and the amount relative to heterospecific pollen. 
Importantly, the ways plants appear to balance these trade-offs depend strongly on the community context, as most species showed flexibility in the strategy they used to cope with competition for pollination.
