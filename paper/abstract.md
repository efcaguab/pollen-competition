Animal pollination is commonly thought as a paradigmatic mutualistic system. 
When plants share pollinators, however, interspecific pollen transfer occurs and plants can start competing for pollinators. 
Although, the extent of competition for pollination and its effects in the pollination service have been well documented in systems with few species, it is not well understood what happens at the community level where many species interact simultaneously and other ecological factors like abundance, visitation, and traits might play an important role. 
By examining a comprehensive empirical data, we confirm that competition is pervasive in pollination communities with only a fraction of species showing evidence of net facilitation. 
Furthermore, we show that the factors that influence the pollination service the most (abundance and visit effectiveness) also introduce a trade-off between the absolute amount of conspecific pollen and the amount relative to heterospecific pollen. 
Importantly, the way plants balance these trade-offs are dependent on the community context as most species showed flexibility on their strategy used to cope with competition for pollination.
