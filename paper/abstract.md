Plant-pollinator interactions are commonly viewed as mutualistic. 
However, plants that share pollinators also compete for effective pollination. 
The extent of this competition for pollination and its effects on pollination service are poorly understood at the community level; many species interact simultaneously and multiple intertwined factors might play a role (abundance, visitation, traits). 
By examining comprehensive empirical data, we confirm that competition for pollination is pervasive and is only partially influenced by the number of shared pollinators. 
Furthermore, the factors that most influence the pollination service (abundance and visit effectiveness) also introduce a trade-off between the absolute amount of conspecific pollen received and the amount relative to heterospecific pollen. 
Most importantly, the ways plants balance these trade-offs depend on the community context, as most species showed flexibility in the strategy they used to cope with competition for pollination. 
Plant-pollinator mutualisms could be better understood as comprising mutualistic and competitive interactions.
