Plant-pollinator interactions are commonly viewed as mutualistic interactions. 
When plants share pollinators, however, interspecific pollen transfer occurs and plants can start competing. 
The extent of competition for pollination and its effects in the pollination service are not well understood at the community level where species interact simultaneously and intertwined factors like abundance, visitation, and traits might play a role. 
By examining comprehensive empirical data, we confirm that competition for pollination is pervasive. 
Furthermore, the factors that influence the pollination service the most (abundance and visit effectiveness) also introduce a trade-off between the absolute amount of conspecific pollen and the amount relative to heterospecific pollen. 
Most importantly, the way plants balance these trade-offs are dependent on the community context as most species showed flexibility on their strategy used to cope with competition for pollination. 
Achieving a  better understanding of plant-pollination communities will require seeing them as both mutualistic and competitive communities.
