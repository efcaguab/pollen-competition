Plant-pollinator interactions are commonly viewed as mutualistic interactions. 
When plant species share pollinators, however, interspecific pollen transfer occurs and plants can start competing. 
The extent of competition for pollination and its effects on pollination service are not well understood at the community level
where species interact simultaneously and intertwined factors like abundance, visitation, and traits might play a role.

By examining comprehensive empirical data, we confirm that competition for pollination is pervasive. 
Furthermore, the factors that most influence the pollination service (abundance and visit effectiveness) also introduce a trade-off between the absolute amount of conspecific pollen received and the amount relative to heterospecific pollen. 
Most importantly, the ways plants balance these trade-offs are dependent on the community context as most species showed flexibility in the strategy they used to cope with competition for pollination. 
Achieving a better understanding of plant-pollinator communities will require seeing them as comprising mutualistic and competitive interactions.
