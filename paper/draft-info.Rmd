* Suggest a reference for sentence in \lr{M-ref-plant-flexibility} if needed. 
* Suggest alternative, more-appropiate, sub-headings if needed.

## Changes since last draft

* Added .git and .drake to .dockerignore to speed up build
* As suggested by Jason I refer to the factors on the main models as mechanisms of pollinator mediated competition. 
* Many minor changes to the text
* Replaced instances of "plant abundance" to the more specific term "floral abundance" (Jamie suggested some people working in the field might be finicky with terminology).
