## Requests to coauthors

* Check text between \lr{M-start-deposition-facil-competition} and \lr{M-end-deposition-facil-competition} where there were changes.
* Check the cover letter. I made small changes based on assessment from EL editor and swapped the order of a couple paragraphs. 
* __Jason__: Could you please double check your grant numbers? They look different to Daniel's. 

## Changes since the last draft

* Renamed visit effectiveness as visit potential throughout to reduce confusion with previous uses of the term.
* Corrected a mistake on the names used for the model terms in Table S5. It used to say "degree" where it should have been "# shared pollinators".
* Corrected caption of Fig S3 which used "trait originality" instead of "functional originality" which is the term we use in the paper
* Paper has been formatted with minimum requirements for initial submission at Plos Biology.
* Added some sentences in the intro to strengthten the link between competition/facilitation and conspecific/heterospecific pollen.
