## Changes since the last draft

* Shortened abstract to required length
* Updated grant numbers in acknowledgements 
* References are stored in its own repository (efcaguab/phd-references). Previously, references were accessed by pulling them as a submodule. This created problems when working from different computres. References are now just downloaded from the remote file in the github.
